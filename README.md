# Fragments

This repository contains codes that I wrote when learning new algorithms/techniques.

* `datasets`: directory for small datasets that are used for demonstration
* `cpp`: directory for algorithms or data structures in C++
* `haskell`: directory for algorithms written in Haskell
* `project_euluer`: directory for solutions to ProjectEuler
* `python`: directory for miscenalleous codes in Python
  * The directory structure is purposefully flat to make relative import from `streamlit` easier
  * `algo`: directory for data structure and algorithms
  * `pattern`: directory for progamming patterns
  * `ml`: directory for algorithms related to Machine Learning
  * `stats`: directory for codes for statistics
